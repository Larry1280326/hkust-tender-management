# HKUST e-Tendering Automation & Gmail Drafter

Automated workflow to:
1. Log in to the HKUST e-Tendering Portal (`https://w5.ab.ust.hk/jstd/td_welcome?page=td_login`) and accept the Terms & Conditions.
2. Scrape all active Tender Notices and parse the enquiry section (Contact Person name, email, phone).
3. Allow interactive selection of suitable tenders (or keyword filtering).
4. Automatically draft personalized enquiry emails directly in **Gmail** (with company details and Business Registration certificate attached).
5. Read your mailbox, track replies from HKUST, and automatically apply organized Gmail tags (e.g. `HKUST Tenders/<tender_no>`).

## Quick Start

### 1. First-Time Setup (Environment & Browsers)

Synchronize project dependencies with `uv` and install Chromium for Playwright:

```bash
# 1. Sync dependencies and create the .venv environment
uv sync

# 2. Install Playwright browser binary (Chromium)
uv run playwright install chromium
```

> **Tip:** Running `uv sync` ensures your editor/IDE recognizes `.venv` immediately. Installing Chromium is required for portal scraping.

---

### 2. Configure Credentials (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or edit existing `.env`):

```ini
# HKUST Vendor Portal Credentials
HKUST_VENDOR_ID=your_vendor_id_here
HKUST_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Path to your Business Registration (BR) Certificate file (PDF or image)
BR_CERTIFICATE_PATH=assets/br_certificate.pdf

# Google Account (Using App Password - Recommended, zero Cloud Console setup!)
# Generate at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password
GMAIL_DRAFTS_URL=https://mail.google.com/mail/#drafts
HKUST_MAIL_TAG=HKUST Tenders

# Company Information (Loaded dynamically into email drafts)
COMPANY_NAME=Your Company Name
CONTACT_PERSON_NAME=Contact Person, Title
CONTACT_EMAIL=contact@example.com
CONTACT_PHONE=12345678
COMPANY_ADDRESS=Your Company Address
# Optional custom sign-off override (defaults to Contact Person + Company Name)
# SIGN_OFF="Best regards,\nYour Name\nYour Company Name"
```

Place your official Business Registration certificate in `assets/br_certificate.pdf` (or customize `BR_CERTIFICATE_PATH`).

### 3. Gmail Integration Setup

The application supports direct Gmail integration without requiring any Google Cloud Console configuration:

#### 1. Direct Gmail Drafting & Mailbox Sync (Google App Password)
1. Ensure **2-Step Verification** is enabled on your Google Account.
2. Go to [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
3. Create an app password (e.g. named `HKUST Workflow`).
4. Set `GMAIL_USER` and `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.
5. **Capabilities**:
   - Saves drafts directly to your Gmail **Drafts** folder via IMAP.
   - Scans your inbox for HKUST replies and organizes them under Gmail labels (e.g. `HKUST Tenders/<tender_no>`).

#### 2. Offline Mode & Direct Web Links (Automatic Fallback)
If `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` is not configured, the tool automatically:
- Exports ready-to-send `.eml` files to `output_drafts/` (double-click to open in Outlook or Windows Mail).
- Generates 1-click pre-filled Gmail compose web links.

---

### 4. Run the Automation

Run directly with `uv`:

```bash
uv run python app.py
```

#### Interactive Main Menu:
- **1. Scrape HKUST Tenders & Draft Emails**: Headless scraping + interactive tender checklist + Gmail draft creation with automatic tagging.
- **2. Read Mailbox & Track HKUST Replies / Apply Tags**: Reads your Gmail inbox, identifies HKUST replies and tender references from subject lines, and applies nested tags.
- **3. Test Google Account Connection**: Verifies Google App Password and IMAP connection.
- **4. Exit**

#### Direct Command Line Flags:

```bash
# Display help and all available CLI arguments
uv run python app.py --help

# Test Google IMAP / App Password connection
uv run python app.py --test

# Read mailbox and display HKUST tender emails / interactive tagging
uv run python app.py --read-mail

# Custom scan limit when reading mailbox (e.g. latest 20 emails)
uv run python app.py --read-mail --limit 20

# Scan mailbox and automatically tag all HKUST tender emails in Gmail
uv run python app.py --tag-tenders

# Run portal scraper with visible Chromium browser
uv run python app.py --visible
```

## Gmail Tagging & Tender Tracking

The tool integrates Gmail labels:
1. **Immediate Draft Tagging**: When drafts are created in Gmail, the `HKUST Tenders` label (configured by `HKUST_MAIL_TAG` in `.env`) is automatically attached to the newly saved drafts.
2. **Mailbox Reply Tracking**: When reading the mailbox, the tool checks each email's sender, subject, and body for HKUST tenders and organizes detected emails under the `HKUST Tenders` label.
